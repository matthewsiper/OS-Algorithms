# OS-Algorithms
OS-Algorithms contains a collection of operating system algorithms such as CPU scheduling, virtual memory, and disk algorithms.

All CPU scheduling algorithms are located in cpu.c. The algorithms implemented in this section include Round Robin, Shortest Remaining Time, Shortest Job First, and Highest Priority.

All virtual memory (specifically paging) algorithms are located in virtual.c. The page fault policies examined in this section include the Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU) and Naive FIFO policies. 

The First Fit, Next Fit, Best Fit algorithms which deal with allocating memory based on distinct memory block policies are located in memory.c.
